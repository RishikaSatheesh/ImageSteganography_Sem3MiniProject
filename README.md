# ImageSteganography_Sem3MiniProject
Hiding information into an image without disrupting the image, using Significant Bit data hiding technique. 

Scripts and pictures from the Star Wars movie were available as a kaggle datasets. 
These scripts were embedded into the images to produce a new set of images that do not seem different than the original, yet hold information in their bits.
The scripts can further be decoded from the images.
